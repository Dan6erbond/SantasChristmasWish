## Bots

### Rudolph The Reinforcer
Rudolph is SCW's Banhammer. He posts new submissions and comments as well as mod-mail and mod-actions on the subreddit to dedicated channels in the Discord server. With reaction-roles the mods can then vote and perform actions on items.

### The Registration Bot
The Registration Bot processes Google Form entries and allows mods to verify the user upon which they can post gift requests.
